# Fitness for Developers in 2019

## Introduction

In this blog I'll be covering the [importance of physical health](#Developer-Fitness), [dieting plans](#Diet), [weightlifting strategies](#Weightlifting), and our new app [ShuffleFit](#ShuffleFit)!

## Developer Fitness

If you work any sort of development or IT related job, it can be extremely difficult to stay fit. Some of us work strenuous 40+ hour weeks with very little physical demand. In fact, we usually just sit in a chair all day staring at a computer screen while snacking and drinking soda. However, it is crucial that you take care of yourself. In doing so you'll increase productivity, improve mental health, and you'll feel more positive overall.

The first excuse is always "I don't have the time". It can be extremely hard to make time to go to the gym. It can also be extremely easy to take 15 minutes out of your day during your lunch break or after work to go for a walk. Walking is very underrated and beneficial. It's a great way to go outside, burn some calories, and get some sun. Invite a coworker and chat about that bug you're stuck on.

Fitness will also help you advance you career. Before I cared about my physical health, I used to always go through the infamous post lunch tiredness. This is where later in the day after you eat a big lunch you're just about ready for a nap. Now, I'll try to eat a relatively healthy lunch that will keep me energized and productive throughout the day. If you feel happier and more energized, you'll feel sharper and more excited in regards to the work you're doing.

Development and fitness go hand in hand. I often find myself stuck on a problem at work, then later that day when I'm at the gym on the treadmill it'll pop back into my head but this time I've thought of a possible solution. I'll go home to try it and often times the solution works. Another fun way to workout and code is using a [Pomodoro timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) but during the breaks do bodyweight exercises like pushups.

## Diet

You're probably wondering, what's the best diet plan for 2019? My answer... all of them. Every diet works. The key with everything is **_consistency_**. You must be able to stick to this diet. If you can't see yourself doing this for the next 10 years and you're miserable, then drop it.

### Calories

Gaining or losing weight is all about *calories in versus calories out*. Each day you consume and burn a certain amount of calories. The formula is as simple as if you exceed your daily caloric intake then you will gain weight (caloric surplus), and if less (caloric deficit) you will lose weight. A great way to tell if you're eating at a caloric surplus or caloric deficit is to track calories using an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718)

### Intermittent Fasting (IF)

This is a popular eating protocol in which you only eat within an 4 - 8 hour time window. The idea behind IF is that if you restrict yourself to two big meals a day within a small time window you will eat at a caloric deficit. I've been using IF for over the past year with an 8 hour eating window and fasting for the other 16. Some days may vary and I usually use the weekend as 2 "cheat days". The main benefits I see are:

- Eating is more enjoyable and rewarding
- I'm more focused while in a fasted state
- Noticeable weight loss and fat loss

There are a ton of other popular diets like keto, vegan, and mediterranean that are very effective, but this was the one has worked best for me personally.

## Weightlifting

After nutrition, getting into the gym is the next big step. However, you wont see results unless you're consistent. Find a schedule that works best for you and **stick** to it. In the beginning it's extremely difficult but after a few months you'll want to go to the gym and feel worse when you don't.

I don't work out a ton to stay healthy. I go to the gym on average 3 days a week (M/W/F) with a day of rest in between and a two day rest during the weekends.

### Progressive Overload

My entire life I've always thought that if I go to the gym consistently I'll keep gaining strength and seeing results. However, showing up is only half the battle. [Progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload) is the concept of always making progress with every exercise. This could be increasing the weight of a lift by five pounds or pushing for one more rep. Keep track of your lifts with a notebook or on your phone. Just make sure that week after week your are making `progress`.

## ShuffleFit

In my free time I enjoy working out and coding, so I thought to myself... why not combine the two? My coworker James Nutter and I created [ShuffleFit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shufflefit/id1469847338). ShuffleFit is an application that generates a random workout for you. You select the body part, how many exercises and ShuffleFit does the rest. Some days in the gym you know what you want to work on but don't feel like mapping out the workout yourself, that is where ShuffleFit shines. Our GitHub is located [here](https://github.com/chaznut/workout), put in some feature requests!

### Tech

I've always wanted to make an mobile app but never had the time to learn Swift. I mainly spend my time in the web world. I started hearing that [Progressive Web Apps (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications) are on the rise and started researching. A PWA is basically a website that can be installed onto your phone just like an app from the store. [Twitter](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/twitter-react-mobile-stack/) just implemented this concept. We used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for it's great PWA support.

We deployed the site and were able to install it on our phone. We wanted to take it to the next step, deploy to the Google and Apple stores. We started researching and there aren't a ton of great resources on converting a PWA to an app. We ended up using [pwabuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) and it just seemed to work. I wont go into the process for registering apps but I will say it was much easier to get into Google Play compared to the App Store.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading! I hope you've learned something new here about either fitness or tech. If you have any questions reach out to me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tony-decarlo-t1cg) or our emails `tonydecarlo11@gmail.com` and `nutterj90@gmail.com`
