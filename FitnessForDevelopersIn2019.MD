# Fitness for Developers in 2019

## Introduction

In this blog I'll be covering the importance of physical health, dieting plans, weightlifting strategies, and my new app ShuffleFit!

## Developer Fitness

If you work any sort of development or IT related job, it can be extremely difficult to stay fit. Some of us work strenuous 40+ hour weeks with very little physical demand. In fact, we usually just sit in a chair all day staring at a computer screen while snacking and drinking soda. However, it is crucial that you take care of yourself. In doing this you'll increase productivity, improve mental health, and you'll feel more positive overall.

The first excuse is always "I don't have the time". It can be extremely hard to make time to go to the gym. It can also be extremely easy to take 15 minutes out of your day during your lunch break or after work to go for a walk. Walking is very underrated and beneficial. It's a great way to go outside, burn some calories, and get some sun. Invite a coworker and chat about that bug you're stuck on.

Fitness will also help you advance you career. Before I cared about my physical health, I used to always go through the infamous post lunch tiredness. This is where later in the day after you eat a big lunch you're just about ready for a nap. Now, I'll try to eat a relatively healthy lunch that will keep me energized and productive throughout the day. If you feel happier and more energized, you'll feel sharper and more excited in regards to the work you're doing.

Development and fitness go hand in hand. I often find myself stuck on a problem at work, then later that day when I'm at the gym on the treadmill it'll pop back into my head but this time I've thought of a possible solution. I'll go home to try it and often times the solution works. Another fun way to workout and code is using a Pomodoro timer and during the breaks doing bodyweight exercises like pushups.

## Diet

You're probably wondering, what's the best diet plan for 2019? My answer... all of them. Every diet works. The key with everything is consistency. You must be able to stick to this diet. If you can't see yourself doing this for the next 10 years and you're miserable, then drop it.

### Intermittent Fasting

## Weightlifting

## ShuffleFit

In my free time I enjoy working out and coding, so I thought to myself... why not combine the two? My coworker James Nutter and I created ShuffleFit. ShuffleFit is an application that generates a random workout for you. You select the body part, how many exercises and ShuffleFit does the rest. Some days in the gym you know what you want to work on but don't feel like mapping out the workout yourself, that is where ShuffleFit shines.
